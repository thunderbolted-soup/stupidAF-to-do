## Plans?
- [ ] Easy to work with tasks.
- [ ] Deleting tasks, executing tasks, clearing the list of completed tasks.
- [ ] Work with the file system to keep tasks in a file.
- [ ] Rewrite some parts for “modularity” so that Execution, Deletion, Creation, etc. are done in another method rather than in the code itself.
